/*
Question 8: You should create four lines that look like this:
console.log(5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.


Explain & TIP: Just like before, use basic math operations to display the number 8. This reinforces how to display outputs in coding.

Answer: Please try to do it yourself first!
(Refer to the answer for Question 7, as it serves the same purpose.)

console.log(5 + 3); // add

console.log(10 - 2); // sub

console.log(4 * 2); // multipl

console.log(16 / 2); // division
