/*
Question 11: Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in an array called names. 
Print each personâ€™s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
*/

/*
Explain & TIP: An array is like a list of items. You can store multiple items, like your friends' names,
 in one variable and access them one by one.
 */

 let names: string[] = ["Zayan", "Zahaid", "Zaryab", "Zaman"]

 for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
     console.log(names[i])
 }
