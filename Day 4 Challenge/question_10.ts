Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
If the programs are straightforward at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each 
program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.
*/

/*
Explain & TIP: Comments are notes in your code that the computer ignores. They help people understand what your 
code does. It's like leaving a note for yourself or someone else who might read your code later.
