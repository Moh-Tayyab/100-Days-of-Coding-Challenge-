Question 25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Assign 'green', 'yellow', or 'red' to a variable called alien_color.

Explain & TIP: Use an if statement to check the alien's color. This introduces you to simple conditionals.

let alien_color1 = "green";

if (alien_color1 === "green") {
    console.log("The alien is green!");
    console.log("You just earned 5 points.");
} 

let alien_color2 = "red";
if (alien_color2 == "green") {
    // No output because the condition is false
}
