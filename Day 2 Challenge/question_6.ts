/*
Question 6: Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters 
at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. 
Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.
*/

/*
Explain & TIP: Save a name with extra spaces or new lines around it. Show it first with the extra space,
then remove the spaces and show it clean. This helps you learn how to clean up text.
